 A pastebin with a lot of taste
================================

PastaBin is a free web application allowing users to pasting text and source
code (called snippet). The syntax of the snippets are automatically colorized
in order to make them more readable.

No registration is required for posting snippets, but registered users can
list, modify and delete their own snippets.

Have fun with PastaBin!
